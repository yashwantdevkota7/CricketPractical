	           regulations that one must follow to play the gentleman's game.</br>
   	   </p>
	   <p>
	      The popularity of the sport has increased over the years
	     and many countries like Nepal and the UAE are preparing to
	     venture into international competition. Television ratings
	      and stadium attendance have been increasing and advertisers
	     are willing to heavily invest in cricket.Many people play
	     just for fun, while many others dream of becoming professionals.
	     Whatever your reason is, knowing all the rules and regulations will
	     help make you a better player.	<p> Generally, the rules apply to 
		 all the formats with the exception
	     of an exclusive rule or two for each one. Essentially, the game
	     of cricket involves two teams who attempt to score runs. The team
	      with the most runs is the winner.</p>

	       <b>Umpires</b><br></br>
		   Cricket umpires are responsible for making decisions and calls in a game of cricket.
		   They also ensure that players and matches follow the rules of the game, taking a
		   similar role to referees in other sports. Most umpires, at least at a professional
		   level, are male, even in women's cricket, and there was only one female umpire at 
		   the Women's Cricket World Cup in 2013. The number of umpires on the field varies 
		   according to the type of match played.Traditionally, cricket matches have two umpires 
		   on the field, one standing at the end where the bowler delivers the ball (Bowler's end)
		   , and one directly opposite the facing batsman (usually, but not always, at square leg)
		   . However, in the modern game, there may be more than two umpires; for example Test 
		   Matches have four: two on-field umpires, a third umpire who has access to video replays,
		   and a fourth umpire who looks after the match balls and takes out the drinks for the on-field umpires.

	      <b><br>Toss</b></br>
          In cricket, the toss is the flipping of a coin to determine which captain will have the right to 
		  choose whether their team will bat or field at the start of the match.
          Before play begins, the captain of each side will inspect the pitch. Based on the pitch and 
		  weather conditions, the captains select their final eleven players. If the pitch is soft or 
		  dusty, the captain will tend to select more spin bowlers; if the pitch is hard, the choice 
		  tends to favor fast bowlers at the expense of spinners.<br></br>

       <p><b>Bowling</b><br>
       <br/>
       Each bowl is known as a delivery and bowlers attempt deliveries in sets of six,
	   which makes up an. When a player has completed their over, a new bowler replaces 
	   the player and bowls their set of six balls from the opposite end of the pitch. <br />
      <br/>
       In limited overs one-day cricket such as the popular 20, 40, and 50 overs versions,
	   a bowler is limited to only 20% of the total overs. However, in first class or Test 
	   match cricket, which is the longest form of the sport lasting up to five days, no
	   such bowling limits exist but the rule, which states that a bowler cannot bowl 
	   consecutive overs, still applies. <br />
       <br/>
       In cricket, bowling a ball well requires great skill and technique as it requires
	   a specific biomechanical action, where the elbow joint of the throwing arm must not
	   straighten out more than 15 degrees during the bowling action. Bowlers are required 
	   to hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder
	   joint, releasing the ball near the top of the arc. <br />

	    <b>Batting</b>
		</br>
        In cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs and prevent
		the loss of one's wicket. Any player who is currently batting is denoted as a batsman, batswoman,
		or batter, regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise. Batting players
		have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in 
		different countries - therefore, as well as having outstanding physical batting skills, top-level 
		batters will have lightning reflexes, excellent decision-making and be good strategists.<br>
	 <b>Four</b>: Four runs are awarded to the batting team if the ball touches or passes 
	              the boundary rope of the ground.<br>
     <b>Six:</b> Six runs are awarded to the batting team if the ball passes the boundary rope 
	             of the ground without bouncing

	 <b>Cricket Pitch</b><br><br>
     The cricket pitch is the field where the game is played. The pitch is 22 yards long and 3 meters wide.
     The middle of the pitch is a protected area where the bowler must avoid running. 
	 This is because running on the protected area will damage the pitch area where the ball 
	 bounces, making it difficult to bat. A bowler is given two warnings for running. Afterward,
	 he is refrained from bowling any further in the innings.
